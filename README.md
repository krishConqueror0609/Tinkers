# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Project Branch

## Overview
This branch of the project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better and uncover insights, patterns, and relationships. It serves as a foundation for subsequent modeling and analysis steps within the main project.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key statistical measures to understand data distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful plots to reveal trends and relationships.
- **Insights**: Highlighting significant findings from the data exploration process.

## References
The EDA draws inspiration from the following resources and best practices:
- Statistical analysis frameworks
- Visualization techniques using Python libraries
- Data science methodologies for exploratory analysis

## Contributions
This branch is open for contributions that improve the EDA process or add additional insights. Feel free to submit pull requests or issues.

## Note
The insights and visualizations in this branch are specific to the dataset used for the project and may serve as a reference for similar analyses in the main project.
